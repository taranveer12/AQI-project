Air pollution refers to the presence of hazardous substances in the air that has adverse effects on health, causing millions premature deaths annually. The heavy concentration of particulate matter is a serious concern. Accurately understanding the sources of air pollution is therefore crucial for preventing and controlling the same. This article presents a detailed survey as well as a comparative study of various Machine Learning models used to forecast air pollution particulate matter. Also, the paper aims to analyse the significant work in predicting air quality with ML Model. Moreover, Random Forest Regression served the purpose of analyzing the relationship between training data and corresponding predicted outcomes for continuous variables.
